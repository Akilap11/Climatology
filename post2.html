                <h1>The impacts of climate change on people?</h1>
                <h3>
                    The impacts of heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, storms, floods and sea-level rise is already devastating for many communities around the world. Impacts are predicted to become catastrophic if governments cannot bring greenhouse gas emissions and global
                    temperature rises under control. Storms, floods and sea-level rise destroy homes and lives In the UK, climate change is causing more extreme weather such as heatwaves and storms. Increased heat in the atmosphere leads to more heavy
                    rainfall and more frequent flooding, often impacting the same areas over and over again. Flooding has turned lives upside-down in Yorkshire, Somerset and Cumbria. And a coastal village in Wales, Fairbourne, is being evacuated because
                    of the growing threat of sea level rise. In the Pacific island nations, Central America, the Caribbean and southern US states such as Louisiana and Florida, hurricanes are increasingly severe and far more frequent, leading to loss
                    of life, homes, harvests or entire farms. In South and Southeast Asia, countries like Bangladesh, Myanmar and the Philippines face more and stronger cyclones or typhoons – which can destroy entire regions. It take years to rebuild.
                    Extreme weather events are devastating to any community. But those in poorer nations, and people living in underprivileged communities in rich nations, also struggle to recover. In the US, government neglect, inequality and racism
                    have led to inadequate emergency responses and very slow recovery. This was seen most starkly after Hurricane Katrina in 2010 and Hurricane Maria in 2017. Sea level rises are already affecting Pacific island nations like Kiribati and
                    the Marshall Islands. Native Americans in Alaska and Louisiana are facing not only a rapid reshaping of their ancestral coastlines, but also the effects of polluting oil and gas drilling. Indigenous Peoples worldwide suffer disproportionately
                    from both the causes and effects of climate change. This is despite often having a deep understanding of how to look after nature and use natural resources sustainably. Heat, drought and fires increase health risks Heatwaves, droughts
                    and wildfires have serious effects on people and communities. As well as the damage caused by fire itself to wildlife and human settlements, smoke inhalation and air pollution from fire is a major health risk. Heat and drought are
                    also bad for human health. There is a limit to how much heat a human body can cope with. And lack of clean water to drink or grow food can cause illness, malnourishment, famine, migration and war. Extreme heat, particularly in cities,
                    can be deadly – particularly for older people. In Europe summer heatwaves have already caused tens of thousands of deaths in some recent years. Heatwaves also worsen droughts around the world. These extended periods without water threaten
                    not only human health, but also how much food can be grown. According to the UN, this has led to alarming rises in global hunger. Heatwaves and drought can lead to wildfires. Wildfires are already affecting many countries around the
                    world on a regular basis. The Amazon, Australia, the Western US and Siberia have all seen alarming wildfires in recent years.
