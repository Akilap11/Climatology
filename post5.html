                <h1>TIKTOK VERSUS CLIMATE CHANGE</h1>
                <h3>It’s not just about dance videos – young activists are using TikTok to change the climate movement one post at a time. social media has become a crucial part of how young activists connect, educate, and inspire each other. And while that’s
                    not new, what is new is how young activists are using one platform in particular: TikTok. As you probably know, TikTok is an app for making and sharing short videos. If you’re not an active user, your first thought is probably “infectious
                    dance videos,” and to be fair, that’s how TikTok first burst into mainstream consciousness. But today, the platform has become much, much more than a vehicle for dance videos (though there are still a lot of amazing ones being made).
                    And with over 1 billion global monthly users on the app, activists can reach a substantial amount of people in mere seconds. That many users - and the app’s history as a platform for creative expression - inevitably invites innovation
                    and new and diverse ways of thought and expression about, well, just about anything. And new and diverse ways of thought and expression is exactly what we’re seeing when it comes to climate action on TikTok. Especially from young activists.
                    MEET ECOTOK-(www.ecotokbusiness.com) In the summer of 2020, a collaborative TikTok group emerged to influence the next generation of activism and education. EcoTok as it’s called, is a collective of 17 environmental activists and educators.
                    A main goal of the group is to celebrate diversity both in their identities and in their approaches to climate action. With over 115k followers, EcoTok has made a huge impact on the climate movement. Critically, the collective has
                    helped normalize talking about climate issues among young people and encouraged other users outside the group to tackle climate issues on their own accounts. The approach is working – and the group’s influence is growing. In less than
                    two years, EcoTok has gone from a small collective to an entire subgenre of TikTok, with the EcoTok hashtag currently fostering over 260 million views. And counting. Part of these exploding numbers come from the simplicity of the subgenre’s
                    mission. At a time when temperatures are (literally) going off the charts, it’s a place to talk about climate with other young people - what it means for them. What they can do. Breaking it down. Making it relatable. Members of EcoTok
                    have started the conversation on a truly global problem while incorporating inclusitivity into their advocacy. The result is an online forum for individuals from all over to contribute creative ideas and provide solutions - generating
                    a new discussion about the climate crisis and how we can actively be a part of tackling it.
