                    <p class="fst-italic">
                        The science is clear: to have any hope of a livable future, we must rapidly, radically reshape society this decade.¹ We know the problems. We have the solutions. And yet, far too many leaders, across sectors, continue to focus on short-term profit and
                        prestige. Society at large remains stuck in lukewarm concern and insufficient action, and too many people who care are still standing on the sidelines. The status quo is not working. To date, conventional climate leadership has
                        centered the voices and ideas of White* men, an imbalance that falls short in both fairness and efficacy.² A preference for facts without feelings, “solutions” without justice, and competition rather than collaboration continues
                        to hold us back from building the biggest, strongest team possible. The good news: Many of today’s most compelling climate leaders, across generations, are women—especially Black, Indigenous, and other women of color. Despite burdens,
                        systemic barriers, and burnout, women are already leading boldly and effectively and throwing open doors to welcome people into climate work. A powerful, transformational climate-feminist ecosystem is emerging. But it's not emerging
                        nearly fast enough—in part because of persistent inequity in climate funding and racism and patriarchy impeding good work. It’s time to wholeheartedly support those who are lighting the way to a just and livable future and to grow
                        feminist climate leadership across all genders and in every corner. * We capitalize all races, following the lead of Dr. Ibram X. Kendi and others

                    <p class="fst-italic">
                        The Climate Communication Project has successfully run its course, and our guidance for how to be more engaging when communicating about climate has been published, but we would like our journey and experiences to create a lasting impact on the climate
                        communications field. To share the lessons we’ve learned along the way, the challenges we faced, and our achievements, we have produced a summative evaluation report. This evaluation report, Creating Lasting Change for Climate
                        Communication, offers a summary of what we set out to achieve and captures insights about how we achieved our objectives, including ways in which others could develop our ideas. The findings presented in our evaluation report have
                        been collected through interviews with the project team, online comments and interactions, audience feedback at our workshops, online altmetrics, and face-to-face conversations.

                    <h3><strong>Project HOPE</strong> </h3>
                    <p>From the air we breathe to the water we drink, the changing climate has serious effects on our health. We are already seeing the direct cost of a warming climate in our air pollution, food production, heat waves, and extreme weather.
                        We can also see the effects more broadly, in widespread conflict and displacement, which often find their roots in competition over precious natural resources. Climate change also has a serious impact on mental health. Disasters
                        like flooding and droughts can elevate levels of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorders. Researchers have also found connections between exposure to poor air quality and increased risk of anxiety, schizophrenia,
                        and personality disorder. People with mental health conditions are more likely to be affected by severe weather conditions, and children are particularly vulnerable. These are only a fraction of the consequences, and each of them
                        has major tolls on our health: 7 million people die every year from air pollution, while heat waves in U.S. cities cause more deaths than every other disaster combined. Displacement can lead to major health issues, including infectious
                        disease, malnutrition, and psychological and emotional distress. Most alarmingly, climate change disproportionately affects the world’s most vulnerable populations. More than 82 million people are displaced worldwide, the most
                        in modern history. The majority are displaced by conflict and violence, in places like Syria and Democratic Republic of the Congo. But a growing number are forced from their homes by disaster; in 2018, more people were displaced
                        by drought in Afghanistan than by conflict. That’s why Health Affairs calls climate change “a bona fide public health crisis in the making.” Climate change is often thought of as a “threat multiplier” </p>
